##CORDIS

**MEC 2024 BioEngineering 1st Place Project**

CORDIS is a machine learning algorithm that takes sensory input from an accelerometer and impedance sensor to adaptively predict patient heart rate and learn to synchronize dual-chamber pacemaker activity.
It aims to reduce pacemaker crosstalk, over/under sensing, and atrioventricular asynchrony that can cause complications in pacemaker patients.
